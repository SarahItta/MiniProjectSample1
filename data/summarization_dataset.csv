"Photosynthesis is a vital process where green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, a pigment that absorbs light energy. Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, which produce ATP and NADPH, and the Calvin cycle, which uses these products to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.","Photosynthesis enables plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert sunlight, CO2, and water into glucose and oxygen in chloroplasts, using chlorophyll in light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle."
